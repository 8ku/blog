Today is the second day after I finished my first IELTS exam. I have a long TO-DO list that I have to finish this year:
- Practising writing
- Keep practise speaking
- Finish the album
- Finish the Demo of my game

An incident occurred today that I really want to record. After the exam, I planned on using my film camera to finish an album which is a present for my friend. However, when I tried to push the shutter, I found out they were not working anymore. I realized that the batteries might be run out. I tried to change the battery but the battery lip was so tight that I couldn't open it without damaging it. Therefore, I had no choice but to take it to a repair shop.

Fortunately, there was a shop near my home which had a great reputation where I decided to go. However, repairing something is usually expensive in Shanghai, so I thought it would cost me a fortune to solve that problem. When the master mechanic said the repair fee was only 4 yuan, I was shocked. These days it's rare to be able to fix something at such a low cost. I was grateful for his help and realized that this was way he had such a good reputation.

Also, I saw a great quote on Twitter tonight that I wanted to **jot down**.
> Some children are raised by themselves. In their process of maturing, their parents are in a state of "ignorance". They don't provide spiritual guidance, nor material support. So until they enter society, they are in a state of chaos. The only rule they learn is "obey". The only method they learn is "everyone else done it". They never examine their own **uniqueness**. Such children either take it and become like their parents. Or if they are unwilling, they have to raise themselves again. 
> 
> They have to shatter their former selves, and find clear fragments that belong to themselves, mold themselves anew, relearn interpersonal rules, societal norms, establish their own set of principles, polish themselves bit by bit, fill in the gaps bit by bit.
