Today I cleaned the house I rent. When I wiped the bag of my guitar, I suddenly felt sad for my instrument since I hadn't played it in 4 or 5 years. 

I've wanted to learn to play a music instrument since I was a child, but I never had a chance until I became financially independent. So as soon as I got my first paycheck, I went online and purchased a ukulele. I don't recall how I felt back then, but I remember being dissatisfied with the tone of the ukulele, it was boring, plain, and not as colorful as the guitar. 

I finally could finally afford to buy a guitar around 6 years ago, so I bought one. I was so excited that I accidentally snapped a string while turning. I assumed that in a short period of time, I could play the guitar as well as a professional, but I was mistaken. I gave up since I thought I didn't have any talent for it.

I attempted to resume guitar lessons today. I finally realised why I enjoy playing the guitar. Maybe this time, since I'm in a different frame of mind, I'll be able to learn how to play the guitar.
