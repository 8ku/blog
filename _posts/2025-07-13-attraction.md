What traits do you think make someone attractive? Kindness, humor, or maybe cuteness? For me, it’s all about that unexpected charm. It took me a while to identify what I truly find appealing in people, and after watching countless hours of a celebrity videos, I finally got it.

If you’re a person with a seemingly precious heart, acting like an angel, — even if it’s genuine —I find that a major turn-off.

In fact, I might even dislike you. I struggle to  connect with people who only show a sunny disposition and douse everyone in excessive humility; it strikes me as insincere. Moreover, when someone tries way too hard to be funny, it inevitably falls flat. 

However, I still question whether it is uncommon, so I brought it to ChatGPT. I received some interesting responses, one of which stated, “Humility, when it’s pronounced or repeated too often, can feel like a social tactic, even when it’s sincere. This disconnect between presentation and perception creates discomfort.”
